MAKEFILE          : to create the .ko files
simple_module.c   : just a module with the init and exit functions
sample_char_drv.c : sample char driver with just prints inside the fops
char_drv_fops.c   : char driver with fops using get_user and put_user
char_driv_fops.c  : char driver with fops using copy_from_user and get_from_user
char_drv_ioctl.c  : char driver with fops and ioctl implemented- to read in upper case (in ioctl example dir)
ioctl_test.c      : user space code to set the ioctl mode b/w 0 and 1 (in ioctl example dir)
char_driv_mmap.c  : char driver with mmap implemented (in mmap_example/driver dir)


Steps to run->
* Check the Makefile to see which modules need to be compiled
* make host                                  (to compile the module and generate the .ko file)
* sudo insmod char_drv_fops.ko               (to insert the module)
* sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/chardev c 258 0     (to make char device entry)
* echo "testing" > /dev/sample_char_dev      (to write to the device file; open,write,close functions are called, visible in the syslog)
* cat /dev/sample_chardev                    (to read the device file; open,read,close functions are called, visible in the syslog)
* sudo rm /dev/chardev                        (to remove the device file)
* sudo rmmod sample_char_driver               (to remove the module)

Useful commands:
* lsmod | grep char (to see list of loaded modules with char in name- can use it to see if insmod worked)
* cat /proc/devices  (to see list of loaded characted devices - find the device name at 258 major number)
* ls -l /dev/sample_chardev (can see the device's major and minor number, can be used to see if mknod worked)
* sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog (to see the syslog- to view the kernel alert/info prints- like those inside the init and exit functions)
