char_drv_ioctl.c  : char driver code with ioctl implemented
Makefile          : to generate the .ko file 
ioctl_test.c      : user space code to test ioctl - mode=0: read from driver as it is
                                                     mode=1: read from driver by converting lower case letters to uppercase
                                                     
 Steps to run->
 make host
 sudo insmod char_drv_ioctl.ko
 sudo  mknod -m 666 /dev/chardev c 258 0
 
 gcc ioctl_test.c -o ioctl_test.out
./ioctl_test.out 0  (sets the ioctl mode to 0)
echo "Testing 1 2 3" > /dev/chardev
cat /dev/chardev
Prints on console: Testing 1 2 3

./ioctl_test.out 1  (sets the ioctl mode to 1- read is done in upper case)
cat /dev/chardev
Prints on console: TESTING 1 2 3
